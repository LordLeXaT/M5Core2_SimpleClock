# M5Stack M5Core2 Simple Clock

This is a very simple clock for the M5Core2

## M5Core2 Library 

* checked 02.03.2021 -> changed code to work with this version

## Usage 

1. Change parameters of ntpServer/gmtOffset_sec/daylightOffset_sec to your needs  

2. Change the WiFi mode as you wish, SMARTMODE = esp smartconfig, FIXEDMODE = static WiFi credentials  

3. Compile and push to the M5Core2  

4. M5Core2 will now show time based on the RTC time  

5. Touch the lower half of the M5Core2-LCD to bring up the menu icons  

## Menuicons 

1. WIFI Smart connect (touch on it [you see the clock stop], then press confirm on the ESP SmartConfig app on your phone, the icon will turn green if WIFI is done  

2. Time Sync (If WiFi icon is green, touch the TimeSync icon once), the icon will turn green if sync is done  

3. Close Menu (will hide the menu icons and disable the touch areas for the 3 icons)  

## Known problems 

sometimes the WiFi is not working as expected, I tried to fix this by  
restarting the complete WiFi but I'm not sure if this helps  
I think this is some ESP32 issue, that sometimes cannot connect to WiFi  
  
As I began with ESP chips I resetted the whole chip by using ESP.restart();  
So this is my first attempt to fix it otherwise
